# Traffic_Lights
This repository contains my project files for Traffic Light segment using Arduino. The project uses an Arduino microcontroller and LEDs to simulate a traffic light system.

The code includes a detailed explanation of the project's functionality, including the timing sequence for the traffic light and pedestrian signals. The project also includes a circuit diagram and a bill of materials for the hardware components.

Overall, this project provides a practical application of microcontroller programming and circuit design. It is suitable for students and hobbyists interested in embedded systems and programming.
